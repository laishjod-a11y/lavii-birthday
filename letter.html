    <h1>My Dearest Maanvi 💖</h1>

    <p>
    These 3 months with you have been the most beautiful beginning of my life.
    I love how comfortable you are with me.
    I love your eyes.
    I love your cute voice that instantly makes my day better.
    </p>

    <p>
    Even though we are miles apart,
    my heart feels closest to you.
    You are my peace, my happiness,
    and my favourite notification.
